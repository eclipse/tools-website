      The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a 
      fully functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 
      the Eclipse platform. Our focus is development on Linux for deployment on 
      Linux, but we are interested in participation from others who would like 
      to extend our work in other directions (e.g. a Windows client, targeting 
      Unix(R) or embedded platforms, wizards for developing applications that 
      use particular library or database or messaging APIs, or extension to other 
      languages). We are looking for contributions from the open source community 
      in the areas of testers, developers and general users who can help us ensure 
      that the C/C++ tools work well on all the Eclipse platforms and compiler 
      environments. There is a <a href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools.cdt" target="_top">newsgroup</a>

        The Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) allows developers to take an existing 
        application model and easily create a rich graphical editor.&nbsp;GEF 
        allows a developer to quickly map any existing model to a graphical editing 
        environment. The graphical environment is the SWT-based drawing plugin 
        "draw2d" (which is part of the overall "GEF" component). The developer 
        can take advantage of the many common operations provided in GEF and/or 
        extend them for the specific domain. GEF is suitable for creating a wide 
        variety of applications, including: flow builders, GUI builders, UML diagram 
        editors (such as work-flow and class modeling diagrams), and even WYSIWYG 
        text editors like HTML. GEF does not assume that you must build one of 
        these applications and is application domain neutral.</p>

      <p><b><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/emf" target="_top">EMF</a></b> <br>
        EMF is a Java/XML framework for generating tools and other applications 
        based on simple class models. EMF helps you rapidly turn models into efficient, 
        correct, and easily customizable Java code. It is intended to provide 
        the benefits of formal modeling, but with a very low cost of entry. In 
        addition to code generation, it provides the ability to save objects as 
        XML documents for interchange with other tools and applications. Models 
        can be created using annotated Java, XML documents, or modeling tools 
        like Rational Rose, then imported into EMF. The code generator turns a 
        model into a set of Java implementation classes. These classes are extensible 
        and regenerable - you can modify them by adding user-defined methods and 
        instance variables. When the model changes, you can regenerate the implementation 
        classes, and your modifications will be retained. This works both ways 
        - changes in the Java code can be used to update the model.<br>
        <br>
        EMF includes an <a href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/scripts/docs.php#overviews">EMF-based 
        implementation of Service Data Objects (SDO)</a>. <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/sdo/" target="_top">SDO</a> 
        is a framework that simplifies and unifies data application development 
        in a service oriented architecture (SOA). It supports and integrates XML 
        and incorporates J2EE patterns and best practices. <br>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/xsd/" target="_top">XSD</a> is a library 
        that provides an API for manipulating the components of an XML Schema 
        as described by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLSchema-0" target="_blank">W3C 
        XML Schema</a> specifications, as well as an API for manipulating the 
        DOM-accessible representation of XML Schema as a series of XML documents, 
        and for keeping these representations in agreement as schemas are modified. 
        XSD has moved from the Technology PMC to the EMF project.<br>
