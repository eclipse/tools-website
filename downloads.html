        On this page you can find the links to the latest builds produced by the 
        subprojects in the <a href="main.html">Eclipse Tools Project</a>. All 
        downloads are provided under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse.org 
        Software User Agreement unless otherwise specified. </p>
      <p>If this is your first time visiting eclipse.org, you probably want to 
        download the platform binary first. These downloads can be found on the 
        <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php" target="_top">Eclipse 
        Platform download page</a>. You can read more about the Eclipse Platform 
        by visiting the <a href="../eclipse/index.html" target="_top">Eclipse 
        Platform PMC </a> main page and by reading the eclipse platform <a href="../eclipse/faq/eclipse-faq.html">FAQ</a>. 
        Once you have a base eclipse platform installed, you can download other 
        plugins such as the ones found on this page. In addition to the plugins 
        found here, you can find other plugins produced at eclipse.org on the 
        <a href="../technology/index.html" target="_top">Eclipse Technology Project</a> 
        main page <a href="../technology/downloads.html">(downloads are here</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>For plugins produced by the larger eclipse community, there is list maintained 
        at the <a href="../community/plugins.html">community plugins</a> page, 
        as well as pointers to various community maintained &quot;lists of lists&quot;.
