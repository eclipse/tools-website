      <blockquote>
      <P>The UML2 API provides developers with an EMF-based implementation of
      the UML 2.0 metamodel for the Eclipse platform. The objectives of this API
      are to provide:</P>
      <ol>
        <li>a useable implementation of the metamodel to support the
          development of modeling tools</li>
        <li>a common XMI schema to facilitate interchange of semantic
          models</li>
        <li>test cases as a means of validating the specification</li>
        <li>validation rules as a means of defining and enforcing levels of
          compliance</li>
      </ol>

        <P>The initial UML2 API was developed by Kenn Hussey (<a href="mailto:khussey@ca.ibm.com">khussey@ca.ibm.com</a>)
        and others at IBM. Kenn is the proposed lead for the UML2 subproject. He
        is currently looking for people who would like to help on this project. 
        </P>
        <P>Partners in this initiative include Borland, Unisys, Fujitsu, and
        Ericsson.

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>The current implementation is nearly complete; it is based on EMF
        Release Version 1.1.1 for Eclipse 2.1.1. The API and associated XMI
        schema are expected to change (perhaps significantly) as the UML 2.0
        specification progresses through the finalization process. It is
        expected that the UML2 API will be used as the basis for several
        upcoming commercial products.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>The plug-ins are written in Java with no native code and thus may be 
          ported to any platform supported by Eclipse.</P>

        <P>Six plug-ins are included:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>org.eclipse.uml2 - Java interfaces and implementation classes for
            all the classes in the model, plus a factory and package (meta data)
            implementation class 
          <LI>org.eclipse.uml2.edit - implementation classes that adapt the
            model classes for editing and display 
          <LI>org.eclipse.uml2.edit.tests - JUnit unit tests for the edit implementation classes 
          <LI>org.eclipse.uml2.editor - a properly structured editor that
            conforms to the recommended style for Eclipse EMF model editors and
            serves as a starting point from which to start customizing 
          <LI>org.eclipse.uml2.tests - JUnit unit tests for the model
            implementation classes 
          <LI>com.ibm.uml2.example - an example showing how an EMF model can be
            converted to/from a UML2 model (to which an Ecore profile has been
            applied) </LI>
          <LI>com.ibm.uml2.example.ui - custom actions and import wizards that invoke the
            converters </LI>
