      <p><b>Description</b></p>
      <p>The C for Eclipse Subproject is building a fully functional C and C++ 
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Eclipse platform. Our 
        focus is development on Linux for deployment on Linux, but we are interested 
        in participation from others who would like to extend our work in other 
        directions.e.g. a Windows client, targeting Unix(R) or embedded platforms, 
        wizards for developing applications that use particular library or database 
        or messaging APIs, or extension to other languages.</p>
      <p>We are proposing this code base form the initial code for the open source 
        C/C++ project hosted on eclipse.org under the eclipse tools project. The 
        project goal would be the completion of a full featured C/C++ environment 
        for all platforms. We are looking for contributions from the open source 
        community in the areas of testers, developers and general users who can 
        help us ensure that the C tools work well on all the Eclipse platforms. 
      </p>
      <p>Our first release function includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for the &quot;autoconf&quot; and &quot;automake&quot; utilities 
          to define new projects or in existing projects imported into the environment. 
          However, use of these tools is not mandatory, and your build may consist 
          of hand-generated makefiles, Perl scripts, or whatever, as long as it 
          can be launched from a command line Easily configurable error message 
          parser, preconfigured for gcc and g++.</li>
        <li>Code browsing, navigation, automatic code completion provided by an 
          integrated C/C++ parser and program database.</li>
        <li>Integrated debugger GUI using gdb, reusing many of the familiar Eclipse 
          debug views but adding new ones for registers, storage, and a debugger 
          console that provides access to the underlying gdb command line interface 
          for advanced or esoteric debugger function.</li>
        <li>Integrated access to the platform man, info, and HTML help. Select 
          a keyword in the editor and hit F1 to search, results are displayed 
          using the Gnome help browser or Konqueror according to your preference.</li>
        <li>Support for projects that are remote, on another Linux system, as 
          well as local development on your Linux desktop or laptop. Projects 
          can be replicated between systems, so you can work locally for a while 
          then replicate to a second Linux system where you rebuild and remotely 
          edit and debug from within the IDE. The mechanism supporting this is 
          extensible and only requires a Java 1.3 runtime on the remote Linux 
          system, in addition to the underlying system utilities (gmake, gcc, 
          gdb, perl) that it invokes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Status</b></p>
      <p>Our work is now at what we describe as a 0.5 level, meaning it isn't 
        yet ready for production use but has progressed to the point where it 
        will be of interest to the Eclipse developer community. Inconsistent or 
        incomplete function, scalability, and stability problems may occur.</p>
      <p><b>Platforms</b></p>
      <p>The plugins are written in Java with no native code and thus may be ported 
        to any platform supported by Eclipse. However, some Linux specific features 
        prereq other tools that may not be found on non-Linux systems.</p>
      <p><b>Content</b></p>
      <p>We provide a total of 15 plugins and packages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>com.ibm.cpp.ui - contributions of a C++ Perspective, views,and actions</li>
        <li>com.ibm.cpp.miners - remotable actors for build, launch, and project 
          management</li>
        <li>com.ibm.cpp.miners.parser - the remotable C/C++ source parser</li>
        <li>com.ibm.cpp.docs.user - online Eclipse documentation</li>
        <li>com.ibm.debug - client-side extensions for debugging non-Java applications</li>
        <li>com.ibm.debug.doc.user - Eclipse documentation for the above</li>
        <li>com.ibm.debug.gdbPicl - server-side wrapper for GDB</li>

          and reference information</li>
        <li>com.ibm.lpex - a Java implementation of the IBM Live Parsing Editor</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Development plan </b></p>
      <p>We are still in the process of defining our development plan however 
        the major items for the first half of 2002 include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>rename our packages to use the org.eclipse prefix</li>
        <li>make it easier to work with the components in the Eclipse Plugin Development 
          Environment</li>
        <li>add debugger function like an interlisted source/assembly view,</li>
        <li>exceptions, conditional and deferred breakpoints</li>
        <li>improve the performance and scalability of the parser and datastore</li>
        <li>simplify the installation and invocation of the server-side components</li>
        <li>begin integrating profiler support</li>
        <li>improve stability</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you want to contribute to the development of this plugin, we welcome 
        the opportunity to work with you. The plan will be updated to reflect 
        the committments made by contributors to this projects. </p>
      <p>The distribution includes a <a href="http://64.38.235.23/tools/cdt/downloads/0.5.0/todo.txt">TODO</a>
