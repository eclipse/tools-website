        Description</B></H2>
      <P>The Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) allows developers to take an existing 
        application model and easily create a rich graphical editor.&nbsp;GEF 
        allows a developer to quickly map any existing model to a graphical editing 
        environment. The graphical environment is the SWT-based drawing plugin 
        "draw2d" (which is part of the overall "GEF" component). The developer 
        can take advantage of the many common operations provided in GEF and/or 
        extend them for the specific domain. GEF is suitable for creating a wide 
        variety of applications, including: flow builders, GUI builders, UML diagram 
        editors (such as work-flow and class modeling diagrams), and even WYSIWYG 
        text editors like HTML. GEF does not assume that you must build one of 
        these applications and is application domain neutral.</P>
      <P> Check out the sample application <a href="gefcapture.gif"> screenshot</a>. 
      </P>
      <P>GEF is divided into two plugins: GEF, and draw2d.</P>

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>The <B>draw2d</B> plug-in provides a standalone rendering and layout 
          package for an SWT Canvas.&nbsp; It includes common shapes and layouts 
          that can be assembled to render almost anything.</P>
        <P><B>Features:</B></P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Double buffered painting and optimized layouts
          <LI>Various Figure and Layouts implementations
          <LI>Simple event routing to figures (mouse and keyboard)
          <LI>Border support on figures
          <LI>Cursor and tooltip support
          <LI>Connection anchoring, routing and decorating
          <LI>Multiple layers
          <LI>Flexible coordinate systems
          <LI>Overview window (thumbnail with scrolling)</LI>
        </UL>

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>The GEF plug-in uses draw2d for rendering, but adds a rich MVC editing 
          framework on top of it.&nbsp; This framework helps ensure that most 
          graphical applications look and behave in a similar way.</P>
        <P>We are looking for contributors who are familiar with graphical editing, 
          including: laying-out "nodes", routing "connections", UI interaction, 
          accessibility, zoom, printing, etc.&nbsp; We are also looking for clients 
          who can help debug and stress the code on different Eclipse platforms 
          and locales.</P>
        <P><B>Features</B>:</P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Tools like Selection, Creation, Connection and Marquee tools
          <LI>A Palette for displaying those tools
          <LI>Handles for resizing objects and bending connections
          <LI>Two types of GEF Viewers (Graphical and Tree)
          <LI> A Controller framework for mapping the business Model to a View 
            <UL>
              <LI>Plug-in policies for mapping interactions with the view to changes 
                in the model
              <LI>Various implementations for showing feedback and adding selection 
                handles
              <LI>Various request types and tools or actions that send these requests 
                to the controllers</LI>
            </UL>
          <LI>Undo/Redo support via Commands and a CommandStack</LI>

        <P>GEF was developed by Randy Hudson (hudsonr <B>at</B> us.ibm.com) and 
          others at IBM.&nbsp; Randy is the proposed lead for the GEF subproject. 
          He is currently looking for people who would like to help on this project.

      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>GEF is being used in several existing commercial products. The API 
          is stable, but we have not claimed binary compatibility with future 
          major releases like the Eclipse Platform.</P>

      <H3><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">Platforms</SPAN></H3>
      <BLOCKQUOTE> 
        <P>The plugins are written in Java with no native code and thus may be 
          ported to any platform supported by Eclipse.</P>
