      The CDT (C/C++ Development Tools) Project is working towards providing a 
      fully functional C and C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 
      the Eclipse platform. Our focus is development on Linux for deployment on 
      Linux, but we are interested in participation from others who would like 
      to extend our work in other directions (e.g. a Windows client, targeting 
      Unix(R) or embedded platforms, wizards for developing applications that 
      use particular library or database or messaging APIs, or extension to other 
      languages). We are looking for contributions from the open source community 
      in the areas of testers, developers and general users who can help us ensure 
      that the C/C++ tools work well on all the Eclipse platforms and compiler 
      environments. There is a <a href="news://news.eclipse.org/eclipse.tools.cdt" target="_top">newsgroup</a> 
      (for access see the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/newsgroups/index.html" target="_top">newsgroups

        The Graphical Editor Framework (GEF) allows developers to take an existing 
        application model and easily create a rich graphical editor.&nbsp;GEF 
        allows a developer to quickly map any existing model to a graphical editing 
        environment. The graphical environment is the SWT-based drawing plugin 
        "draw2d" (which is part of the overall "GEF" component). The developer 
        can take advantage of the many common operations provided in GEF and/or 
        extend them for the specific domain. GEF is suitable for creating a wide 
        variety of applications, including: flow builders, GUI builders, UML diagram 
        editors (such as work-flow and class modeling diagrams), and even WYSIWYG 
        text editors like HTML. GEF does not assume that you must build one of 
        these applications and is application domain neutral.</p>

      Modeling Framework (EMF)</b></a> <br>
      The EMF project is a modeling framework and code generation facility for 
      building tools and other applications based on a structured data model. 
      From a model specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime 
      support to produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set 
      of adapter classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the 
      model, and a basic editor. <br>
      <br>
      EMF includes the <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/xsd.php" target="_top">XML 
      Schema Infoset Model (XSD)</a> project and an EMF-based implementation of 
      <a href="http://eclipse.org/emf/sdo.php" target="_top">Service Data Objects 
      (SDO)</a>. XSD provides a model and API for manipulating components of an 
      XML Schema, with access to the underlying DOM representation of the schema 
      document. SDO is a framework that simplifies and unifies data application 
      development in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). It supports and integrates 
      XML and incorporates J2EE patterns and best practices. <br>

        The Eclipse Visual Editor project is a framework for creating GUI builders 
        for Eclipse. It will include reference implementations of Swing/JFC and 
        SWT GUI builders, but intends to be useful for creating GUI builders for 
        other languages such as C/C++ and alternate widget sets, including those

        The UML2 project is an EMF-based implementation of the UML 2.0 metamodel

        a useable implementation of the metamodel to support the development of 
        modeling tools, a common XMI schema to facilitate interchange of semantic 
        models, test cases as a means of validating the specification, and validation 
        rules as a means of defining and enforcing levels of compliance. Read
