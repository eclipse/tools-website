          The Eclipse Tools Project (Tools) is an open software development project 
          dedicated to developing a wide range of development tools and tools-specific 
          components for the Eclipse Platform. Typically, this would include tools 
          for computer programming languages (compilers, editors), performance 
          tools, debuggers, and test tools. The project charter is a living document 
          that will be updated to reflect the evolution of the development process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p><b>Mission</b><br>
  The mission of Eclipse Tools Project is to foster the creation of a wide
  variety of tools for the Eclipse Platform. The project provides a focal point
  for diverse tool builders to ensure the creation of best of breed tools for
  the platform. The Tools project provides a place where a single point for
  interaction and coordination for all tools developers can occur which will
  minimize overlap and duplication, ensure maximum sharing and creation of
  common components and promote seamless interoperation between the diverse
  types of developed tools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  project will promote the Eclipse vision and attempt to foster subprojects
  that set the &#8220;gold standard&#8221; for tools implementers.</p>
  <p>The Eclipse Tools Project will use its experience in developing tools for
  Eclipse, to provide technical requirements and feedback to the Eclipse PMC.</p>
  <p><b>Scope</b><br>
  The Eclipse Tools Project encompasses the tools being build for the Eclipse
  Platform. The main focus of these tools will be development tools such as
  computer programming language tools (compilers, editors, debuggers),
  performance tools, and test tools.</p>
  <p>The set of tools being built by the Eclipse Tools project will grow over
  time. Initially, we expect tools like a C/C++ IDE, as well as tools for
  existing languages that don&#8217;t have existing IDEs (Lisp, Scheme). In addition,
  we expect that a wide range of debuggers for programming languages will
  leverage the Eclipse debug frameworks.</p>
  <p>The list of the projects under the tools PMC will be maintained as an
  addendum to this charter (Attachment A).</p>
  <p><b>Project Management Committee</b><a name=PMC></a><br>
          The Eclipse Tools Project is managed by a small group known as the Eclipse 
          Tools Project Management Committee [Tools PMC].</p>
        <p>The Tools PMC is responsible for the strategic direction and success 
          of the Eclipse Tools Project.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>This governing body is expected to ensure the project&#8217;s 
          welfare and guide its overall direction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
          </span>The PMC is responsible for overall development direction, conflict 
          resolution, development processes and infrastructure, and the overall 
          technical success of the project.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>The PMC Lead is appointed by the Board. The initial PMC is selected by the
  PMC Lead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, to become
  a member of the PMC, an individual must be nominated by a member of the PMC,
  and unanimously approved by all PMC members. The goal is to keep the
  membership of the PMC very small.</p>
  <p>In the unlikely event that a member of the PMC becomes disruptive to the
  process or ceases to contribute for an extended period, the member may be
  removed by unanimous vote of remaining PMC members.</p>
  <p>The PMC is responsible for maintaining and updating the project charter.
  Development must conform to any rules or processes outlined in the charter,
  so a change to the development process may necessitate a change to the
  charter. Changes must be unanimously approved by all members of the PMC.</p>
  <p><b>Roles</b><br>
          The Eclipse Tools Project is a meritocracy -- the more you contribute, 
          and the higher the quality of your contribution, the more you are allowed 
          to do. However with this comes increased responsibility.</p>
  <p><b>Users</b><br>
  Users are the people who use the products that the Project produces. People
  in this role aren't contributing code, but they are using the products, reporting
  bugs, and making feature requests and suggestions. Users are encouraged to
  participate through the user newsgroup(s), asking questions, providing
  suggestions, and helping other users. Users are also encouraged to report
  problem reports using the bug tracking system. </p>
  <p><b>Developers</b><br>
  Users who contribute code or documentation become developers. Developers are
  the people who contribute code, fixes, documentation, or other work that goes
  into the product. Developers are also encouraged to participate in the user
  newsgroup(s), and should monitor the developer mailing list associated with
  their area of contribution. When appropriate, developers may also contribute
  to development design discussions related to their area of contribution.
  Developers are expected to be proactive in reporting problems in the bug
  tracking system.</p>
  <p><b>Committers</b><br>
  Developers who give frequent and valuable contributions to a subproject, or
  component of a subproject (in the case of large subprojects), can have their
  status promoted to that of a &quot;Committer&quot; for that subproject or
  component respectively. A Committer has write access to the source code
  repository for the associated subproject (or component), and gains voting
  rights allowing them to affect the future of the subproject (or component).</p>
  <p>In order for a Developer to become a Committer, another Committer for the
  subproject (or component) can nominate that Developer or the Developer can
  ask for it. Once a Developer is nominated, the Committers for the subproject
  (or component) will vote. If there are at least 3 positive votes and no
  negative votes, the Developer is recommended to the PMC for commit
  privileges. If the PMC approves, the Developer is converted into a Committer
  and given write access to the source code repository for that subproject (or
  component). Becoming a Committer is a privilege that is earned by
  contributing and showing discipline and good judgement. It is a
  responsibility that should be neither given nor taken lightly</p>
  <p>At times, Committers may go inactive for a variety of reasons. The
  decision making process of the project relies on active committers who
  respond to discussions and votes in a constructive and timely manner. The PMC
  is responsible for ensuring the smooth operation of the project. A Committer
  that is disruptive, does not participate actively, or has been inactive for
  an extended period may have his or her commit status removed by the PMC.</p>
  <p>Active participation in the user newsgroup and the appropriate developer
  mailing lists is a responsibility of all Committers, and is critical to the
  success of the project. Committers are required to monitor and contribute to
  the user newsgroup.</p>
  <p>Committers are required to monitor the developer mailing list associated
  with all subprojects and components for which they have commit privileges.
  This is a condition of being granted commit rights to the subproject or
  component. It is mandatory because committers must participate in votes
  (which in some cases require a certain minimum number of votes) and must
  respond to the mailing list in a timely fashion in order to facilitate the
  smooth operation of the project. When a Committer is granted commit rights
  they will be added to the appropriate mailing lists. A Committer must not be
  unsubscribed from a developer mailing list unless their associated commit
  privileges are also removed.</p>
  <p>Committers are required to track, participate in, and vote on, relevant
  discussions in their associated subprojects and components. There are three
  voting responses: +1 (yes), -1 (no, or veto), and 0 (abstain).</p>
  <p>Committers are responsible for proactively reporting problems in the bug
  tracking system, and annotating problem reports with status information,
  explanations, clarifications, or requests for more information from the
  submitter. Committers are responsible for updating problem reports when they
  have done work related to the problem.</p>
  <p><b>Subprojects</b><br>
  The work of the Project is organized into subprojects. New subprojects must
  be significant works consistent with the mission of the Eclipse Tools
  Project, be recommended by the PMC, and confirmed by the Board. Subprojects
  can be discontinued by decision of the Board.</p>
        <p>Subprojects will typically target the current stable release of the 
          Eclipse Platform. In some cases where a subproject requires new Platform 
          features, the subproject may decide to target the latest development 
          stream of the Eclipse Project. The PMC for the Tools project is responsible 
          for ensuring that subprojects sync up on a common release of the platform.</p>
  <p>When a new subproject is created, the PMC appoints a subproject lead to
  act as the technical leader and names the initial set of Committers for the
  subproject. Thereafter the PMC may appoint a new subproject lead from time to
  time as required, but the new subproject lead must be confirmed by a majority
  of the other Committers of the subproject. Subproject leads are accountable
  to the PMC for the success of their project.</p>
  <p><b>Subproject Components</b><br>
  The PMC may decide to divide subproject further into components. If a subproject
  is divided into components, commit privileges are normally granted at the
  component level, and the committers for a given component vote on issues
  specific to that component. Components are established and discontinued by
  the PMC. When the PMC creates a component it appoints a component lead to act
  as the technical leader and names the initial set of Committers for the
  component. The component lead is designated as a committer for the subproject
  and represents the component in discussions and votes pertaining to the
  subproject as a whole. Component Committers do not participate in votes at
  the level of the subproject as a whole, unless they are also the component
  lead.</p>
  <p><b>Infrastructure</b><br>
          The infrastructure required to support the development process is the 
          responsibility of the PMC. The Eclipse Tools Project will have at least 
          the following:</p>

  <p><b>The Development Process</b><br>
  Each subproject lead must produce a development plan for the release cycle,
  and the development plan must be approved by the PMC and by a majority of
  Committers of the subproject.</p>
  <p>Each subproject must identify, and make available on its web site, the
  requirements and prioritizations it is working against in the current release
  cycle. In addition, each subproject must post a release plan showing the date
  and content of the next major release, including any major milestones, and
  must keep this plan up to date.</p>
  <p>The Committers of a subproject or component decide which changes may be
  committed to the master code base of a subproject or component respectively.
  Three +1 ('yes' votes) with no -1 ('no' votes or vetoes) are needed to
  approve a code change. Vetoes must be followed by an explanation for the veto
  within 24 hours or the veto becomes invalid. All votes are conducted via the
  developer mailing list associated with the subproject or component.</p>
  <p>Special rules may be established for subprojects or components with fewer
  than three Committers. For efficiency, some code changes from some
  contributors (e.g. feature additions, bug fixes) may be approved in advance,
  or approved in principle based on an outline of the work, in which case they
  may be committed first and changed as needed, with conflicts resolved by
  majority vote of the Committers of the subproject or component, as applicable.
  More restrictive rules for releasing changes may be established by the PMC
  near the end of release cycles or for maintenance streams.</p>
  <p>The master copy of the code base must reside on the project web site where
  it is accessible to all developers and committers. Committers must check
  their changes and new work into the master code base as promptly as possible
  (subject to any check-in voting rules that may be in effect) in order to
  foster collaboration among widely distributed groups and so that the latest
  work is always available to everyone. The PMC is responsible for establishing
  a release engineering and build process to ensure that builds can be reliably
  produced on a regular and frequent basis from the master code base and made
  available for download from the project web site.</p>
  <p>The PMC is responsible for establishing the level of testing appropriate
  for each subproject, and approving the test plans.</p>
  <p>All development technical discussions are conducted using the development
  mailing lists. If discussions are held offline, then a summary must be posted
  to the mailing list to keep the other committers informed.</p>
