<p><b>Outline</b></p>
<p>The IDE implementors technology exchange is intended for people who are writing 
  programming language IDEs on top of the eclipse platform. Java, C/C++, Smalltalk, 
  Python, Ruby, Scheme, Pascal or any other language! Come to this working session 
  to discuss the common issues in writing language IDEs. If you have written an 
  eclipse plug-in for your favorite language or even if you plan to write one 
  and want to talk to others who have done it, this session is for you.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Session</b></p>
<p>The session will have 4-5 speakers who will present a short overview of their 
  respective IDEs. Each presenter has been asked to fill in a short feature status 
  sheet to get us started in discussion common issues, and shared technology. 
  The goal of this session will be to start a dialog in how we could pursue more 
  sharing of technology in building IDEs. In past ad-hoc discussions with various 
  IDE implementors and eclipse developers, we have speculated about some common 
  language IDE features which could be used to support many additional languages 
  IDEs on eclipse. This in turn would foster interest in improving these IDEs 
  with feature and performance enhancements and tighter levels of integration 
  with Eclipse. </p>
<p>Without pre-judging the session, some ideas on common technologies for IDEs 
  have included</p>
<p>a) common debugger for compiled languages (C/C++, Fortran, Cobol, Ada)</p>
<p>b) common utilities for parsers (including partial/incorrect code parsers), 
  indexers (with persistance) for searching</p>
<p>c) common target descriptions (embedded to server) such that IDE implementors, 
  program launchers (local and remote)</p>
<p>d) utilties for basic integrations (token based syntax colorer, non-context 
  sensitive code assist, consoles and process control, </p>
<p><b>Participants</b></p>
<p>John Duimovich, Smalltalk IDE</p>
<p>Dan Shaefer, Eclipse CDT, C/C++ IDE</p>
<p>(To be confirmed) Michael Scharf, WindRiver, Programming Language Agnostic 
  IDEs</p>
<p>Martin Aeschlimann, Eclipse JDT, Java IDE</p>
<p><i>Person TBD - Scripting or Agile Language IDE</i></p>
<p><b>IDE Implementors Questionaire. </b></p>
<p>There are many possible levels of integration with Eclipse. The simplest integration 
  is to use Eclipse as your edit, compile, run (and possibly debug) system. The 
  next level is to create some type of program model (parse source) so that you 
  can implement language aware functionality. As the integration becomes more 
  advanced, the opportunities become richer and features like program manipulation 
  (refactoring, code generation, full round trip support for code generation systems 
  that use programming languages as their intermediate language).</p>
<p>For simplicity, I decided to describe IDEs in terms of levels of integration 
  with eclipse. </p>
<p>1) Editor Level Integration - Basic Integration (Level 0)</p>
<p>Functions supported: Text editor for source files, external compiler, compile 
  errors parser into markers, launch external debugger, token based syntax coloring</p>
<p>b) Language Aware Integration - (Level 1)</p>
<p>Function Supported - outline view, hierarchy/structure view, syntax based coloring, 
  code assist, structured search (references, declarations), structured compare. 
  Eclipse debugger support. </p>
<p>c) Advanced Language Aware Integration - (Level 2)</p>
<p>Functions supported: refactoring, quick fix, intentional programming (type 
  inferencing), DOM for language and extension to these tools,</p>
<p>d) Uber-Integration - JDT class integration (Level 3,4,5)</p>
<p>Functions Supported: all of the above and more. Continued innovation in IDE 
  technology. </p>
<p><b>Feature Survey</b></p>
<p>I would like everyone to fill in a feature / implementation sheet. The current 
  set of categories is incomplete however itis a start. If you come up with new 
  items, we can add to the list and fill out a IDE comparison grid.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="features.xls">excel spread sheet</a> with some data I made 
  up about theprojects. As we get new categories, we can update the various information 
  about the IDEs. </p>
<p><b>Other IDE implementation items we could discuss during this session</b></p>
<p>1) Performance Tools</p>
<p>2) Test Tools</p>
<p>3) Modelling</p>
<p><b>See you all in Anaheim.</b></p>
