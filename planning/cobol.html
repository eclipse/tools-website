<p><strong>Project Name:</strong> COBOL<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Project Leaders:</strong> Ron Langer<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Project Description:</strong> The COBOL IDE for Eclipse Subproject will 
  build a fully functional COBOL Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for 
  the Eclipse platform. Our focus is COBOL application development on Windows/Solaris/Linux 
  for deployment on each platform. We are interested in participation from others 
  who would like to extend our work in other directions. e.g. wizards for developing 
  applications that use particular library or database or messaging APIs, or extension 
  to other languages.</p>
