<p><strong>Project Name: </strong><br>
  <br>
  <strong>Project Leaders:</strong> May be one person, or you may optionally list 
  the entire PMC, or key committers. The term &quot;leaders&quot; is purposefully 
  vague. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Project Description: </strong>Summary of project. URL to main Page <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Executive Summary:</strong> Please list the key issues and directions 
  which the project is currently dealing with. This is your opportunity to let 
  everyone know what you think are the important things going on within your project. 
  This is the most interesting and relevant piece of the project summary! <br>
  <strong><br>
  List of currently shipping software distributions (if more than one, please 
  list by component name):</strong> We would typically expect at least the current 
  release version and the current maintenance stream version for each component 
  made separately downloadable by the project. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Key Release Dates: </strong>List the key milestone dates, with particular 
  precision for the upcoming quarter. <br>
  <br>
  <strong>URL to current planning document: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Future Direction:</strong> A forward looking statement of possible 
  items or direction of a furture, unplanned release. Items in this section are 
  speculative and should be taken as a statement of intent but not as a committed 
  plan item. </p>
