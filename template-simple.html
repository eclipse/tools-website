      <p>This page lists the people that are currently playing the PMC and subproject 
        leadership roles described in the <a href="eclipse-charter.html">project 
        charter</a>. You will notice that there are many OTI/IBM people listed... 
        it's not because we want to do all the work (believe us!) - its just because 
        we built the first release of eclipse before it became an open source 
        project, and others haven't had enough time yet to get involved in key 
        roles. We welcome new people who want to get involved and can make a contribution. 
        The Eclipse Project is a meritocracy. The more you contribute the more 
        responsibility you will earn. </p>
      <p>We ask that you do not email us directly. Instead - use the <a href="../mail/index.html" target="_top">mailing 
        lists</a>. Mailing lists have been set up for each area of work, and are 
        the best way to get involved.</p>
      <p>The Eclipse Project is managed by a small group known as the Eclipse 
        Project Management Committee (<a href="eclipse-charter.html#PMC">PMC</a>). 
        The work of the Project is organized into subprojects. Each subproject 
        has a leader who has overall responsibility for its success. Large subprojects 
        are further divided into component teams, each of who has a leader that 
        is responsible for its overall success. We have listed just the PMC and 
        subproject leaders here but you will encounter many dedicated eclipse 
        project committers and developers in the <a href="../newsgroups/index.html" target="_top">newsgroup</a> 
        and <a href="../mail/index.html" target="_top">mailing lists</a>.</p>
