Eclipse Tools Logo Icons and Images
==============================

This directory contains a collection of "Tools Logo" images and icons. 

Contributed in bug 370021 [1] they are primarly intended for those that would like to use a common "Tools Logo" icon, for various purposes such as their "branding icon" for features represented in the Eclpse "About Box". It is thought this is one way to reduce clutter in the "About Box", especially for "low level" libraries (such as GEF, and others) that casual end-users would seldome seek out to install, but are installed automatically along with many other higher level tools. Read the bug [1] for history and discussion and to provide feedback or improvements.  

See Eclipse Help [2] and the Eclipse wiki [3] for more information about "branding" and the use of icons.
